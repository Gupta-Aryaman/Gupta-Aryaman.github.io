      <description>Sync vs Async What is a synchronous programming?
Synchronous programming is a programming paradigm in which operations are executed sequentially, one after the other. In this model, each operation waits for the previous one to complete before moving on to the next step. This sequential execution can lead to &amp;lsquo;blocking&amp;rsquo; operations, where certain tasks may take a significant amount of time to finish. These blocking operations can pause the entire program&amp;rsquo;s execution, forcing it to wait until the time-consuming task is done before it can proceed.</description>
