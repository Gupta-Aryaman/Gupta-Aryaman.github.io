      <description>What on earth are decorators??? Decorators are essentially single reusable functions that take a &amp;ldquo;function&amp;rdquo; as input and return a modified version of it. Decorators are just a bit different from regular functions because they wrap the &amp;ldquo;input function&amp;rdquo; to extend its functionality without modifying it.
What does wrapping mean?
import time start_time = time.time() **call your function** #calling your function end_time = time.time() print(&amp;#34;Time Taken = &amp;#34;, end_time-start_time) Here you can see that your function call is being &amp;ldquo;wrapped&amp;rdquo; between lines of code.</description>
