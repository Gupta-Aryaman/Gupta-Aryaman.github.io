      <description>Making a MongoDB cluster &amp;ldquo;Production Ready&amp;rdquo; by performing database Replication and Sharding (horizontal fragmentation)
What is Replication? Replication is the method of duplication of data across multiple servers. For example, we have an application and it reads and writes data to a database and says this server A has a name and balance which will be copied/replicate to two other servers in two different locations.
By doing this, will get redundancy and increases data availability with multiple copies of data on different database servers.</description>
